# Image Element Detection using Computer Vision
This project demonstrates how to detect different elements such as rectangles, circles, logos, and text boxes in an image using computer vision techniques. The implementation is done in Python using the OpenCV library.
## Overview
The main goal of this project is to showcase how computer vision algorithms can be used to identify and localize various elements in an image. The detection process involves preprocessing the image, detecting edges, finding contours, and classifying the contours based on their properties.
## Features
Preprocessing the input image by converting it to grayscale and applying Gaussian blur to reduce noise.
Detecting edges in the preprocessed image using the Canny edge detection algorithm.
Finding contours in the edge-detected image to identify shapes and objects.
Classifying contours into different categories such as rectangles, circles, logos, and text boxes based on their properties.
Printing out the detected elements along with their positions.
Getting Started
## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
Python (version 3.0 or higher)
OpenCV library
NumPy library
Google Colab (if using Colab notebooks)
Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your_username/image-element-detection.git
Install the required libraries:
pip install opencv-python numpy
Usage
Replace the sample image with your own image in the provided code.
Run the code to detect elements in the image.
View the detected elements and their positions printed in the console.
Example
Below is an example usage of the code:

# Example usage
image_path = '/content/Screenshot 2024-03-23 233800.png'

detected_elements = detect_elements(image_path)

print_detected_elements(detected_elements)
